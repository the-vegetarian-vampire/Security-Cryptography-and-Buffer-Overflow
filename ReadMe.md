## Vulnerabilities and Exploits

Vault 7 - [wikileaks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vault_7)   
`Speculative execution` - an optimization technique where a computer system performs some task that may not be needed. Work is done before it is known whether it is actually needed, so as to prevent a delay that would have to be incurred by doing the work after it is known that it is needed. If it turns out the work was not needed after all, most changes made by the work are reverted and the results are ignored. [Vox](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1BRw32nMqg)

## Hash Functions

`hash function` - A hash function is a function that takes an input (a large amount of data) and produces a fixed-size output (hash or digest) that represents the input in a way that is useful for a variety of purposes, such as verifying the integrity of the data or detecting duplicates.      

f(x) =(x \* 127) mod 13
